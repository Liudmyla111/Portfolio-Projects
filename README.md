![Portfolio-Projects](Project%201.%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20of%20Coffee%20Bean%20Sales/coffee%20beans%20sales.jpg)

### Project Goal:
1. **Understand the Data Structure:** Identify and analyze key features, data types, and the overall structure of the dataset, including orders, customers, and products.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Detect and handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
3. **Analyze Trends and Patterns:** Explore relationships within the data, including sales trends over time, coffee type popularity, roast levels, and product line performance.
4. **Generate Insights:** Provide actionable insights to enhance sales strategies, optimize inventory, and adjust pricing. Focus on product profitability and seasonal demand patterns.

### Key Steps:
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis
- Outlier Detection and Handling
- Time Series Analysis

### Skills Applied:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning and Transformation, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization.

### Tools & Technologies:
Python (pandas, numpy), Jupyter Notebook, Data Visualization Libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).

### Key Insights:
- **Sales Growth**: A steady increase in sales over time, suggesting effective sales strategies.
- **Seasonal Demand**: Consistent sales peaks during specific months, likely tied to holidays or promotions.
- **Product Performance**: 'Lib' coffee with 'L' roast is the most profitable, while 'Rob' has lower prices and profitability.
- **Regional Preferences**: The U.S. is the strongest market with 'Ara' as the top coffee type. Preferences vary in other regions.
- **Pricing Impact**: Higher-priced items tend to yield more profit, indicating that pricing strategy directly affects profitability.
- **Significant Outliers**: Notable outliers in Unit Price, Price per 100g, and Profit may reflect special cases or data anomalies.

### Recommendations:
- **Pricing Strategy**: Focus on higher-priced items, especially 'Lib' with 'L' roast, to increase profitability.
- **Market Targeting**: Prioritize the U.S. market and promote the popular 'Ara' coffee type. Tailor offerings to grow sales in Ireland and the UK.
- **Seasonal Promotions**: Align marketing efforts with seasonal sales peaks to maximize high-demand periods.
- **Outlier Investigation**: Review detected outliers to determine if they indicate data entry errors or significant trends, and adjust strategies as needed.

## Project 3: Predicting Medical Insurance Costs

### Project Goal:
1. **Feature Identification:** Assess key factors (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and medical costs) and their impact on insurance pricing.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, address outliers, and normalize data for consistency.
3. **Build Regression Model:** Develop a regression model to predict individual insurance costs based on the datasetâ€™s features.

### Key Steps:
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Building
- Model Evaluation

### Skills Applied:
Data Cleaning and Transformation, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Model Evaluation, Statistical Analysis.

### Tools & Technologies:
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook, Data Visualization Libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).

### Key Insights:
- **Smoking Impact**: Smoking status has the most substantial effect, with smokers paying significantly more.
- **BMI & Age Correlation**: Higher BMI and age correlate with higher insurance costs.
- **Regional Influence**: Regional differences exist but are less impactful compared to other features.
- **Minimal Impact from Children**: Having children shows little impact on insurance costs.

### Recommendations:
- **Premium Adjustment for Smokers**: Adjust premiums for smokers to account for higher associated medical costs.
- **BMI-Related Incentives**: Offer discounts or incentives for maintaining a healthy BMI to promote healthier lifestyles.
- **Age-Based Premiums**: Implement premium adjustments reflecting the increased health risks associated with aging.
