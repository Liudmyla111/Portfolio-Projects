Project Name: Exploratory Data Analysis of Coffee Bean Sales
Project Goal: 
•	Understand the Data Structure: Identify and understand the key features, data types, and overall structure of the dataset, including orders, customers, and products.
•	Data Cleaning: Detect and handle any missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data to ensure accuracy and reliability for analysis.
•	Analyze Trends and Patterns: Explore relationships and patterns within the data, such as sales trends over time, the popularity of different coffee types, roast levels, and the performance of various product lines.
•	Generate Insights: Provide meaningful insights to enhance sales strategies, optimize inventory management, and refine pricing strategies. Focus on understanding product profitability and identifying seasonal demand patterns.
Key Steps:
•	Data loading and cleaning
•	Univariate analysis
•	Bivariate analysis
•	Multivariate analysis
•	Outlier detection and handling
•	Time Series Analysis

Skills Applied: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data cleaning and transformation, Statistical analysis, Data visualization.
Tools & Technologies: Python (pandas, numpy), Jupyter Notebook, Data visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).
Key Insights:
•	Sales are steadily increasing over time, indicating growing demand or effective sales strategies.
•	Sales show consistent peaks during specific months, suggesting seasonal demand, likely linked to holidays or promotions.
•	'Lib' coffee type, especially with the 'L' roast, has the highest profits. In contrast, 'Rob' has lower prices and profits, indicating different market positioning.
•	The U.S. is the strongest market, with 'Ara' being the most popular coffee type. Preferences for other coffee types vary by country.
•	Higher-priced items tend to yield slightly more profit, indicating that pricing strategy directly impacts profitability.
•	There are significant outliers in Unit Price, Price per 100g, and Profit, which may represent special cases or data anomalies.
Recommendations:
•	Adjust pricing strategies to focus on higher-priced items, particularly 'Lib' with 'L' roast, to maximize profits.
•	Focus marketing efforts on the U.S. market and promote the popular 'Ara' coffee type. Explore opportunities to increase sales in Ireland and the UK by tailoring product offerings to local preferences.
•	Align promotions with identified seasonal peaks to maximize sales during high-demand periods.
•	Investigate detected outliers to determine if they represent data entry errors, special cases, or significant trends. Adjust analysis or business strategies accordingly.

Project Name: Predicting Medical Insurance Costs
Project Goal:
•	Identify key features (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and medical costs) to understand their influence on insurance pricing.
•	Handle missing or inconsistent data, including addressing outliers and normalizing data for consistency.
•	Build a regression model to predict individual insurance costs based on the dataset’s features.
Key Steps:
•	Data loading and cleaning.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis. 
•	Feature engineering.
•	Model selection and building.
•	Model evaluation.
Skills Applied: Data cleaning and transformation, Feature engineering, Regression modeling, Model evaluation, Statistical analysis.
Tools & Technologies: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook, Data visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).
Key Insights:
•	Smoking status has the largest impact on insurance costs, with smokers paying significantly more than non-smokers.
•	BMI and age also strongly correlate with higher insurance costs, with higher BMI and older age leading to higher premiums.
•	Region shows some differences in insurance costs, but these are less significant compared to other features.
•	Children do not have a major impact on insurance costs, showing minimal variation across different values.
Recommendations:
•	Premium adjustment based on smoking status: Since smokers have much higher medical costs, insurers should consider higher premiums for smokers to cover potential medical expenses.
•	Incentives for maintaining a healthy BMI: Insurers could provide discounts or incentives for individuals maintaining a healthy BMI to encourage healthier lifestyles and reduce future medical costs.
•	Age-based premium adjustments: Since medical expenses rise with age, insurers could implement age-based premium adjustments to reflect the increasing risk of health issues as individuals get older.
