### Tools & Technologies:
Python (pandas, numpy), Jupyter Notebook, Data Visualization Libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).

### Key Insights:
- **Sales Growth**: A steady increase in sales over time, suggesting effective sales strategies.
- **Seasonal Demand**: Consistent sales peaks during specific months, likely tied to holidays or promotions.
- **Product Performance**: 'Lib' coffee with 'L' roast is the most profitable, while 'Rob' has lower prices and profitability.
- **Regional Preferences**: The U.S. is the strongest market with 'Ara' as the top coffee type. Preferences vary in other regions.
- **Pricing Impact**: Higher-priced items tend to yield more profit, indicating that pricing strategy directly affects profitability.
- **Significant Outliers**: Notable outliers in Unit Price, Price per 100g, and Profit may reflect special cases or data anomalies.

### Recommendations:
- **Pricing Strategy**: Focus on higher-priced items, especially 'Lib' with 'L' roast, to increase profitability.
- **Market Targeting**: Prioritize the U.S. market and promote the popular 'Ara' coffee type. Tailor offerings to grow sales in Ireland and the UK.
- **Seasonal Promotions**: Align marketing efforts with seasonal sales peaks to maximize high-demand periods.
- **Outlier Investigation**: Review detected outliers to determine if they indicate data entry errors or significant trends, and adjust strategies as needed.

## Project 2: Loan Approval Prediction.

![Portfolio-Projects](Project%202.%20Loan%20Approval%20Prediction/loan_approval.jpg)

### Project Goal:
1. **Data Understanding:** Examine the dataset to understand key factors affecting loan approval, such as applicant demographics, loan terms, and credit history.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data.
3. **Build a Predictive Model:** Create a machine learning model to predict loan approval based on various applicant features.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable predictions.

### Key Steps:
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Training
- Model Tuning and Optimization
- Model Evaluation

### Skills Applied:
Data Cleaning and Transformation, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning Model Development, Model Evaluation and Optimization, Statistical Analysis.

### Tools & Technologies:
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook, Data Visualization Libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).

### Conlusion:
The goal of this project was to develop a model to predict loan approval based on applicant characteristics, such as income, credit history, and assets value. The analysis revealed that income and credit history were the most significant predictors of loan approval. Applicants with higher incomes and higher cibil score had a much higher likelihood of loan approval, while other factors, played a smaller role.
Our predictive model achieved an accuracy of 99%, suggesting that it can effectively support lenders in making data-driven decisions. To improve loan approval processes, lenders should prioritize income verification and offer services to applicants with poor credit histories, such as credit improvement programs.

## Project 3: Predicting Medical Insurance Costs.

![Portfolio-Projects](Project%203.%20Predicting%20Medical%20Insurance%20Costs/medical_costs_prediction.jpg)

### Project Goal:
1. **Feature Identification:** Assess key factors (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and medical costs) and their impact on insurance pricing.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, address outliers, and normalize data for consistency.
3. **Build Regression Model:** Develop a regression model to predict individual insurance costs based on the datasetâ€™s features.

### Key Steps:
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Building
- Model Evaluation

### Skills Applied:
Data Cleaning and Transformation, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Model Evaluation, Statistical Analysis.

### Tools & Technologies:
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook, Data Visualization Libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).

### Key Insights:
- **Smoking Impact**: Smoking status has the most substantial effect, with smokers paying significantly more.
- **BMI & Age Correlation**: Higher BMI and age correlate with higher insurance costs.
- **Regional Influence**: Regional differences exist but are less impactful compared to other features.
- **Minimal Impact from Children**: Having children shows little impact on insurance costs.

### Recommendations:
- **Premium Adjustment for Smokers**: Adjust premiums for smokers to account for higher associated medical costs.
- **BMI-Related Incentives**: Offer discounts or incentives for maintaining a healthy BMI to promote healthier lifestyles.
- **Age-Based Premiums**: Implement premium adjustments reflecting the increased health risks associated with aging.
